Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

	Inline elements do not disrupt the flow of content they are nested within.
	Block elements will break to a new line and occupy the full width of the 
	parent element by default and are effected by height and width properties.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

	It is positioned to a specific location on the page relative to its nearest non-statically positioned ancestor.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

	display: inline-block

	<p>, <div>, and <ul> are block by default. <a> and <span> are inline by default. <img> is inline-block by default.

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

	The box-model describes different features of an element that determine how much "space" it occupies. It is made of four layers:
	The content layer is the inner-most and is what is being displayed by the element.
	The next is padding, which is the space between the content and the border of the element.
	The border is invisible by default, but can be displayed in a variety of ways and sizes.
	The element's margin is the space between border and any surrounding elements.

	Once upon a time, the box-model was quirky to work with, as you could establish a size for the box, but it would be altered by
	any changes to the padding, content, or border. Using box-sizing: border box, such things will alter inside of the perimeter established,
	making it much easier to predict how changes in code will effect the display of in element.
